/**
 * DEMO DATA — every number in this file is invented.
 *
 * It lives in one module, under one obviously-fake name, so that before
 * submission you can grep for `demoMarket` and find every fabricated figure in
 * the frontend. Previously these were inlined in FarmerDashboard.jsx beneath an
 * "Agmarknet Live" badge, which is the version of this problem that loses marks.
 *
 * Anything rendered from here must carry a <DemoStamp />.
 *
 * TODO(data): replace with real sources. Do not hand-write updated numbers.
 *   Mandi rates & arrivals
 *     data.gov.in — "Current Daily Price of Various Commodities from Various
 *     Markets (Mandi)", published by the Directorate of Marketing & Inspection
 *     (Agmarknet). Requires an api.data.gov.in key.
 *     The backend already has a client stub: backend/src/services/agmarknetService.js
 *   Trade volumes / buyer demand
 *     e-NAM (enam.gov.in) — no open API at time of writing; needs a data-sharing
 *     request, so treat as out of scope for the hackathon build and keep stamped.
 *
 * Also note: ai-engine/app/services/price_service.py currently returns
 * "LightGBM + LSTM Agmarknet V2" from a hardcoded lookup table, and lightgbm is
 * in requirements.txt but never imported. That claim needs either a real model
 * behind it or a rewritten label — separate from this file, but the same issue.
