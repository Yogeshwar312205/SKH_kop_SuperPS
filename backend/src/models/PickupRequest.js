/**
 * A farmer asking for their lot to be collected.
 *
 * This is the demand side of the capacitated VRP and it is the reason the
 * request carries coordinates rather than place names: distance drives
 * insertion cost, insertion cost is what the fleet owner ranks on, and a
 * request we cannot locate must be reported as unrankable rather than given a
 * plausible-looking position. Same rule as backend/src/data/mandiGeo.js.
 *
 * The farmer does not choose a truck. They state what they have, where it is,
 * where it is sold and when it can be collected; the fleet owner's dispatch
 * screen decides which of their own vehicles it costs least to send.
