/**
 * The market view every farmer-facing screen reads from.
 *
 * What changed, and why it matters:
 *
 * This used to fuzzy-match the government feed against four hardcoded mandis
 * (Vashi, Pune, Nashik, Pimpalgaon) and show only those. Two things went wrong
 * with that. The feed's most recent hundred postings for a crop are whichever
 * markets happened to report first that morning, so those four were usually
 * absent and the screen silently fell back to invented numbers — in practice
 * only Tomato and Onion ever resolved live. And even when it worked, showing
 * four markets out of the ~290 that report in Maharashtra is not optimisation;
 * it is a shortlist someone else picked.
 *
 * Now every reporting mandi comes through, ranked by what actually lands in
 * the farmer's hand: rate × weight, minus real road freight, minus commission.
 * That ranking is the product's whole claim — a farther mandi at a higher rate
 * often beats the one down the road — so `advantage` below returns the
 * arithmetic that justifies it, not just the winner.
